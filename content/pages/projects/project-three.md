In this project we had all started by creating games of our own ideas, then we grouped up to create a game based off some of OET's favorites, however they liked many of the ideas, so each group made games based off combined ideas of what OET think would make a fun and interactive game that was still educational for a younger audience.

I hade worked on the sonar system along with the lights that allow for the player to search for and find sea creatures in the darker depths of the ocean.

I had a great time working together with my group members on this and combining our ideas to share and show off to OET, for them to use for examples of what they may like in the future.
