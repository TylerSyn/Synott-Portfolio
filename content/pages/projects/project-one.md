  The VR Dog project was a favorite project of mine, with the player being able
  to play fetch with a variety dogs. This was a project that I had many ideas
  for before it's beginnings, but haven't had much time to put into it.

The VR Dog project has to be one of my favorite projects that I have worked on.

I had come up with the idea for my intro to VR class for my final, to create an experience like Nintendogs, allowing someone to play with a virtual pet. 

I had a fun time creating the features for this and wish to come back to the project some day. To polish things up and add more to it.

If I were to go back to the project some of the things that I'd do to it would be

*   add customization like hats and scarfs

*   add in a affection feature, along with food and water

*   add in competitions to win money for customizations

*   add in a home hub area for the player to feed and buy things at

*   add in more areas for the player to go to
