  A Bearable Experience was a game that I worked on for a class, having 4 weeks
  to work on the game in total. You chase around animals as a bear to try and
  stay alive for as long as possible

This project was made for my VR class final, and I wish I had more time work on this project inside and outside class. 

There are many things that I'd like to add to this project if I had a chance

*   better animations

*   being able to feed, brush, etc

*   possibly make it so it's non-VR compatible

*   create a customizable home area to use as a hub

*   more areas to play with the dogs at

*   competitions for rewards and customizations

I think this is a project that I'd like to work on more, as it feels almost nostalgic with how similar to Nintendogs it is.
