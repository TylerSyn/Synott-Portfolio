For this project I had worked on system like

*    Items

*    Inventory

*    Guns

*    Asset implementation for the designers

*    Level loading

*    Menu's and UI

 As well testing managing results and talking to my team about the results we had gotten from testing. 

The overall goal of the project was to make a fun fps horror shooter and release it on steam which we had managed to do.

I was the one who managed the steam page as well as getting the game up on steam and making sure it was all set to be released and available.
