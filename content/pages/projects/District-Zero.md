This game was chosen from 3 other games to expand on and this one was chosen. It started off by simply chasing around enemies to kill them, but then it soon evolved having a score system, hunger, day/night cycle, and a popular favorite ***Hats*** that you can wear as the bear.

I had personally worked on many of the system for this project having worked on

*   the animal AI, for both prey and the other predators

*   day/night cycle

*   hunger and timer

*   score system

*   and the spawn system that changes based off deaths and proximity

If I had more time to work on this game, I would have liked to program the AI to run away form the player, as well as actually give the animals other than the bear animations.
