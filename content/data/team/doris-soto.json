But in all seriousness I do wish to create games that many people can enjoy in some way shape or form. \n\nI find the process of making games interesting, in how 2D and 3D are so similar yet different in the processes, and even more interestingly how the VR process works.\n\nAnd I wish to one day be in the process of making a game that ends up being very popular.\n"
